Article Summarizer

This project provides an efficient tool to extract and summarize text from an uploaded HTML article. It combines web scraping, text processing, and summarization techniques to create concise, readable summaries of the provided content. This README outlines the project structure, features, and usage instructions.

Features

HTML Parsing: Processes HTML content and extracts clean text for analysis.
Text Summarization: Implements a text-rank-based summarizer to generate concise summaries.
Streamlined Output: Produces a structured and easy-to-read summary of lengthy articles.
Simple Integration: Can be used with Jupyter Notebook or as a standalone script.
Error Handling: Manages edge cases like empty input or unsupported content formats gracefully.
Project Structure

article-summarizer.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook implementing the summarization pipeline.
article.html: Example input file containing a sample article.
Outputs Folder: Contains the resulting summary text, showcasing the pipeline's functionality.
How It Works

Upload an HTML File:
Input an HTML document (like article.html) into the pipeline.
HTML parsing cleans up unwanted tags and extracts raw text.
Text Preprocessing:
Strips out metadata and redundant HTML content.
Segments text into meaningful sections.
Summarization:
The algorithm generates key sentences to summarize the input article.
The result is concise while retaining the article's primary themes.
Output:
The summary is saved or displayed in a readable format.
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
Required Libraries:
bs4 (BeautifulSoup)
nltk
numpy
networkx
re (Regex)
To install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Project

Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-link>
cd article-summarizer
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook article-summarizer.ipynb
Follow the steps in the notebook:
Upload the HTML file.
Run each cell to generate the summary.
Review the summarized output.
Example Output

Input: An HTML article with ~1000 words.

Output: A clear and concise summary with ~100-200 words, retaining key insights.

Known Limitations

Works best with structured HTML articles.
May not handle images, tables, or non-textual data in HTML files effectively.
Future Enhancements

Support for PDF or DOCX file inputs.
Integration with APIs for real-time article fetching.
Improved summarization models leveraging pre-trained transformers (e.g., BERT, GPT).
